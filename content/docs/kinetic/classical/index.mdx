Kinetic equations are fundamental in various fields such as plasma physics, astrophysics, and semiconductor physics. They describe the evolution of particle distributions in phase space, which is a high-dimensional space that includes both position and velocity coordinates. Solving these equations analytically is often challenging due to their complexity and the presence of multiple scales.
